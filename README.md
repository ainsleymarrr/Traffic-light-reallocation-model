# Traffic-light-reallocation-model
This model uses a two-queue approach to ensure simplicity, with traffic data updated at fixed timesteps and signal timing updated every cycle. Pressure is defined as a combination of current queue length and incoming vehicle arrival. Green times are allocated proportionally to pressure while limited by maximum and minimum constraints.
